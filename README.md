CRYPTOVERSE - A REACT JSX PROJECT

The Purpose of this project is the creation of a web page using the Architecture of Redux and
the React library and that is in turn to obtain information through an API.
With the trend and direction that cryptocurrencies take these years there are more and more
programmers who decide to immerse themselves in this ecosystem so I have proposed to give
more visibility to the matter and facilitate the availability of information.
The application must be able to collect information about different cryptocurrencies, display
graphs and get the links of these same. I have decided to use the new React and redux library
since it is an emerging technology to make a usable and maintainable design over time and it
is the one I have been using during my internship and thus put into practice what I have
learned. I have proposed to create a web version and another adapted for different mobile
devices so that it can be adapted to all types of users comfortably through a more intuitive
and visual interface thus achieving a more efficient application. It is intended to give a
personal assessment about this architecture and why it is gaining popularity in the software
industry.
